# Smart Scheduler AI Agent

This project is a complete, voice-enabled, and personalized AI agent that helps users find, schedule, modify, and delete meetings. It is built with a Flask backend serving a sophisticated, hybrid web interface where users can interact via typing or voice commands, and even see the agent's step-by-step reasoning.

The core logic is powered by a `SchedulerAgentVoice` class built with LangGraph, enabling complex, multi-turn conversations and intelligent tool use.

## ‚ú® Key Features
